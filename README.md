# Game Workstore Network Library

Network Library for Unity projects based on old UNET! The transport layer will be updated for a better one when unity drops support for LLAPI, or earlier.
Use it your own risk!

# How to install

> "com.gameworkstore.networklibrary": "https://github.com/GameWorkstore/networklibrary.git"

And wait for unity to download and compile the package.
